"Jakilip's Amazing Dodge Engine" - a personal C++ game engine intended for performance heavy 2D games, specifically genres like bullet hell or tower defense, using SFML as my framework. Currently in very early stages, after this engine is complete I will develop a lot of my future games on top of it.
